Hi, I'm Thandi Mpofu, and I've always been fascinated by technology, and now I'm excited to turn that interest into real projects with code. I'm learning programming languages like Javascript and Python, and I love solving problems and seeing my creations come to life. I also have a thing for css and making things look great. I'm here to collaborate, learn, and contribute with others in this field. Outside of coding, you can find me enjoying music, dancing, or just hanging out with friends and family.
